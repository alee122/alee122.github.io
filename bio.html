	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>I'm from Arlington MA and I'm studying computer science at Tufts University. In tech I'm passionate about hardware-software solutions (like Nest and random kickstarters) and disruptions to old industries that function better as software (like Uber or Simple finance).</p>
	<p>In my free time I like to read, cook, and play boardgames with my friends. I mostly read magazines when I'm in school, especially The Economist and Wired.</p>
