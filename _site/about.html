      <div class="body"><p>I am studying Logic and Computation at the Technical University of Vienna. I moved here from Boston in September and I decided to start a blog because I don’t really use social media because people might see what I post there. This is a nice place to post things without anyone getting a notification that I think what I’m doing is important to post about.</p>

<p>I’ll probably use this mostly like Instagram? Just a picture and a few paragraphs when I post? But no one will see and even if someone does I won’t really know.</p>

<p>The pictures will be bad <em>Mike Yeung</em> because my phone doesn’t have a very good camera and I don’t care that much but hopefully they get the idea across.</p>

<p>Vienna is cool!</p>
