<h1> About</h1>
<p>   </p>

<p>I moved from Boston to Vienna to study Logic and Computation at TU Wien but also to deal with my covid cabin fever.</p>

<p>I’ll probably use this blog mostly like Instagram ie a post is some pictures and a paragraph or two. But crucially, an Instagram no one will ever see and that has no comments. I can’t imagine someone I don’t know in real life will ever read this so if you want to comment you can text me.</p>

<p>The pictures will be bad <em>Mike</em> because my phone doesn’t have a very good camera and I don’t care that much but hopefully they get the idea across.</p>
