<h1> Salzburg/Bavaria (sorta)</h1>
<p> 15 Feb 2022  </p>

<p>I went to Salzburg again, this time with some friends from school (one of whom is from Salzburg). It was fun to get the insider tour of things like the last water driven flour mill that makes delicious brioche with raisins warm from the oven.</p>

<p>We put our luggage in the train station lockers (so convenient!) and left to walk around the city. Austrians have their own unique locker sizing system:

<p>We looked around some of the same palaces, I still appreciate this box:

<p>The parts of Salzburg that leave the valley offer some great views, although the downside of wandering around with a local is comments like “oh yeah, everyone takes a picture of that.” Oh well, the majority has the right idea.

<p>I also picked up on a few things I didn’t see last time, like this antique store called “electric lobster.”

<p>And, more pathetically, the fanciest McDonald’s sign I’ve ever seen:

<p>The next day we went to the town of Hallein to do a salt mine tour.

<p>The town has a museum about salt extraction through the ages and a reconstruction Celtic village, unsurprisingly when I make a group of friends it’s the kind of group that would like to spend an hour looking at potsherds and grave goods then poking around in tiny thatched huts. For the mine tour itself we did a lot of walking through tunnels wearing our coats tucked into our mine jumpsuits and took a ferry across an underground salt lake.

<p>We also took a quick trip to Germany!
