<h1> Cafe Central</h1>
<p> 01 Feb 2022  </p>

<p>It’s maybe the least hidden gem kind of place to go but I really like Cafe Central. I won’t stand in line to get in but I will get out of the house kind of early on a Tuesday and then read a logic book in a <em>salon</em> (put some kind of accent on that).</p>

<p>The children (Hannah and my friend Felicia who is also doing this master’s) tell me this is called “romanticizing your life” but I don’t really have to put any force of will behind it when the ceilings are this nice:
