<h1> Entrapment</h1>
<p> 07 Jan 2022  </p>

<p>I was walking to a subway station near the neighborhood my relatives lived in during the turn of the century (according to my mom) that is also the neighborhood that has the cutest Christmas market (according to me) and passed this sign (for kale):

<p>I turned into the alley and it became even clearer that someone had laid a trap for nearby millenials:

<p>When I got to the store I realized it was a trap for me specifically (a sale on heirloom beans):

<p>Very cute! A little expensive but I did buy kale and beans (avocados here are for emergency use only). They had some tasty chocolate dipped spelt cookies too. I can’t get over that spelt is called “Dinkel” here so I feel driven to buy anything made with it. I can’t tell you why exactly this is so funny to me.</p>
