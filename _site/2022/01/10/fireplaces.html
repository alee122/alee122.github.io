<h1> Fireplace Cafe</h1>
<p> 10 Jan 2022  </p>

<p>I found a whole list of cafes with fireplaces in Vienna but so far Café Jelenik is my favorite. To me it’s like the Viennese equivalent of a classic American diner, the food is cheap and comes in large portions (ok, Europe large) and you can choose from a limited array of traditional options. It feels like it’s in the only place it could exist in. The booths are upholstered in a green velvet that’s just a little bit shabby, which I think makes it more relaxing to spend a few hours chatting here.

<p>I did think their collection of books was a little funny.

<p>They also have the standard newspapers-on-wicker-frames that I think are really cool, but I didn’t get a picture so here’s one stolen from Google Maps that kind of features them:
