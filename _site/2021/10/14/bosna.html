<h1> Bosna</h1>
<p> 14 Oct 2021  </p>

<p>I went to see a show for a cool band I found by searching through Viennese bands on bandcamp. It was on a Thursday night with 8am class the next morning but totally worth it.</p>

<p><a href="https://alexfranzzehetbauer.com/about">The opener</a> was a guy dressed in cow print flares stomping around with a microphone in one hand and a speaker in the other. The venue is also a hotel? So he would slam in and out of different rooms while coughing hoarsely. When he eventually made it to the stage he created feedback for about 10 minutes and then stood and sung a classically beautiful song.

<p>The act I was really excited about was great, honestly I just suggest you listen to them.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous notes (texted enthusiastically to a friend):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But anyway, I’m at this noise show that is super cool and wow is it nice to live in a city cheap enough that someone can just be occupied doing weird shit</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the venue is super cool, old tiny stage but they built seating risers where the stage used to be so it’s like looking into the audience while watching the show</p>
