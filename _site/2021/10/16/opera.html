<h1> Opera</h1>
<p> 16 Oct 2021  </p>

<p>I attended my first opera, kind of by mistake! The woman who was my host mom when I was here in high school invited me to see something that I understood involved opera and was called Peter Grimes. I thought that was the name of a tenor or something who might perform some arias but no, it’s a whole opera. (“Oh, a modern one!” is the response from the two people I know who would not have made my same mistake. Modern means the 40s.)

It was a cool experience though, especially since Cynthia is the kind of person who knows everyone. We went back stage during the intermission and one of the performers gave me chocolate pudding.
