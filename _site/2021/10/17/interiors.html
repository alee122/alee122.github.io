<h1> Interiors</h1>
<p> 17 Oct 2021  </p>

<p>I really like seeing the inside of residential buildings in different countries for the same reason I like going grocery shopping when I travel: I like imaging I actually live somewhere.</p>

<p>Apparently I still feel this way when I <em>do</em> live in a foreign country because I was very happy to help my housemate pick up various secondhand pieces of furniture as an excuse to be nosy and see cool courtyard entrances like this:

<p>Sometimes I’m not creepy about it and was actually invited to my friends’ houses. I don’t know why I like her kitchen so much but I like that you really couldn’t find something like this in the US. I think the ceilings are 12 feet?
