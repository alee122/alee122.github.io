<h1> Markets</h1>
<p> 28 Oct 2021  </p>

<p>I was excited to leave behind the American tradition of the weekly shop and planning meals weeks at a time instead of a quick shop every few days for whatever you feel like eating or when you can stop by a convenient street market and for the most part that has panned out!

<p>It almost makes up for how inconvenient it is to find things that are normally present in US supermarkets in major cities:

At some point I will pay 5 euros for a can of tomatillos and be deeply resentful. But I think the situation will improve as I build up my pantry stash.</p>

<p>I got here in time for the last apricots:

<p>My impulse shopping for vegetables usually ends up staying under 10 euros

<p>Just some veggie glamor shots:
