<h1> Moving Apartments</h1>
<p> 27 Nov 2021  </p>

<p>I didn’t fully understand how many months this room was open for (two, oops!) but it’s been a good run and now I have a chance to meet new people outside of school with a different group of people and can keep in touch with my now-former roommates.

<p>I will miss this district though, on a clearer day you can see the mountains around Vienna.

<p>I’ve been living next to a chocolate factory, and a walk to the tram every morning that smells like perfect brownies fresh from the oven has been both a blessing and a curse.
