<h1> Plague</h1>
<p> 22 Nov 2021  </p>

<p>Austria has a nationwide lockdown as of today so this weekend I made sure to take advantage of the kinds of things that will be closed: restaurants, bars, coffee shops, movie theaters, museums. In kind of a morbid frame of mind I visited the plague monument:</p>

<p>And finally went to the Secession museum to see the Beethoven frieze, which also features Pestilence.</p>

<p>Even the church near my school was built in honor of the end of a pandemic, the pediment has a tiny Vienna skyline in the background which you can’t really see in this bad picture but trust me.</p>

<p>The older art refer to pandemics past, but contemporary art hasn’t gotten to the triumphal stage yet.</p>

<p>We were lucky to have a really beautiful weekend.</p>

<p>Besides going to museums I made sure to go out for food that I won’t make at home, especially if it’s also an Austrian specialty. So: giant Wiener schnitzel the size of my face, Kaiserschmarrn (sort of a pancake dish; easy to make at home but I wanted to know what it should taste like), and finally:</p>

<p>(I sent this picture to my friend who is also a recent transplant from Boston and she sent back a picture of a half dozen donuts she and her boyfriend bought.)</p>
