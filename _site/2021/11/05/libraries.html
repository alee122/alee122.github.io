<h1> Libraries</h1>
<p> 05 Nov 2021  </p>

<p>Public libraries aren’t as common here as they are at home and my university library is impossible to get space in due to covid restrictions. That means I’ve been checking out different random libraries.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Austria has a legal library with some carrels and an atrium that I think is really neat. If you go up to the roof there’s a cafe that’s only slightly overpriced with a great view of the city.</p>

<p>You have to go through a metal detector to get in and it’s much easier to gain entrance if you are conservatively dressed instead of going with your punk friend who won’t remove his 80 or so safety pins from his bag and coat and just leaves instead.</p>

<h2 id="other-libraries-include">Other libraries include:</h2>

These are just some windows I like in the building with the library, the reading room itself is much more sleek and modern.</p>
