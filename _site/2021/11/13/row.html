<h1> Rowing</h1>
<p> 13 Nov 2021  </p>

<p>Finally got in touch with the rowing club I wanted to join by resorting to the, shudder, phone. Kind of a pain to get to for now but the apartment I’m moving to next month is a 10 minute walk away.

<p>Part of the appeal of joining a club was the chance to access a wider circle of friends if I was having trouble making them at school, but that has gone just fine. Instead I think it will be a good venue for practicing German because rowers only have 5 conversations anyway.

<p>So far it’s a good place to practice understanding the Viennese accent/dialect (not sure where to draw the line) with the coach who is from an older generation and doesn’t switch to English immediately. His feedback on my form must be about one of the finite number of things I’ve done wrong for years so I can understand what he’s commenting on once I fix the problem and he says something approving.</p>
