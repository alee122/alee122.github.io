<h1> Salzburg</h1>
<p> 29 Dec 2021  </p>

<p>We made it to Salzburg after dark because of our Hallstatt stop but we did go to mom’s favorite beer hall from when she was a student (still there, maybe a few more animal skulls on the walls). No luck on the bar that’s in a cave where you could push 10 cent pieces into the soft rock until the whole area with in arms reach was silver (or at least this is the story I think I’ve been told). Still cool to just walk around, the city is built into the cliffs in a lot of places:

<p>Next morning we walked around the old city where we were staying (made parking a nightmare but convenient the next morning). Found a cool display of terrifying hedgehog postcards.

<p>It’s really cool to be in the middle of a random street and then there’s a giant snowcapped mountain at the end of it. Unfortunately it’s a little hard to capture.

<p>We also hiked up to the castle (they let you get to the top before telling you you have to pay).

<p>I think the view was worth it.

<p>The only (grudging) recommendation I got from my Salzburger friend was <a href="https://www.220grad.com/locations/220grad-nonntal/">a coffee shop</a> and unfortunately we didn’t have time to stay. The coffee really was good though and the barista gave me tiny cookies for all four of us.

<p>Some of the fanciest vandalism I’ve ever seen.
