<p>Finally got to sneak into the “Blue Bar” at the Hotel Sacher, which is as fancy as it is cramped (very) with walls covered in peacock blue silk and intricate golden molding. Some friends and I have been getting turned out when we try to sneak in because it’s for hotel guests only in theory but I think they didn’t want to deal with us the day after Christmas.
