<h1> The Third Man</h1>
<p> 23 Dec 2021  </p>

<p>This is essentially another entry in the series of posts about how nice it is to live somewhere rent is cheap. Someone liked a classic movie set here enough to dedicate three store fronts to displaying his personal collection of Japanese record releases of the soundtrack etc.

<p>The museum is open one day a week and otherwise you have to request that they open it for you on a specific day. It’s not like this is in the middle of nowhere either, it’s right by my school. It’s a good movie if you get the chance to watch it but dang.</p>

<p>It also has some interesting historical information about the time period the movie was shot in: the ground was still covered in the rubble from WWII bombings and the city was split into four quarters like Berlin.

<p>My family also made time to go on the ferris wheel from the climax of the film. This picture roughly points at my new apartment.

<p>The soundtrack holds up, actually, if you like increasingly frantic zither playing (and I do, apparently).</p>
