<h1> Glühwein and Ceramics</h1>
<p> 12 Dec 2021  </p>

<p>Had a fun quarantine evening in at one of my friends’ apartments: we watched <em>Death of Stalin</em>, drank home made mulled wine and ate some of the Christmas cookies, had a vegan lasagne someone brought (I’ll allow it, he made bechamel with almond milk) and then played cards.</p>

<p>Plus I got to snoop in yet another apartment building! Nothing like going through someone’s book case (the literary version of Spotify blend playlists) and then enjoying the ceramics murals that are on every floor for some reason:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/oskar_apt/2.jpg" alt="2" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/oskar_apt/3.jpg" alt="3" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/oskar_apt/4.jpg" alt="4" /></p>

<p>The pictures are bad because I was getting roasted for thinking the art was exciting and so I rushed.</p>
