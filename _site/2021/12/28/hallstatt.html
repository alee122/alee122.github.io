<h1> Hallstatt</h1>
<p> 28 Dec 2021  </p>

<p>We knew we wanted to spend some time seeing more of Austria (partially to give our lovely host a break from us) so that we could visit Salzburg where mom studied abroad in college and where she and my dad went on their first trip together.</p>

<p>Hannah insisted on trying to go to Hallstatt too, despite the crazy additional train time and transfers it would take, all for a town that you can walk through in 20 minutes or so. Ultimately we decided to take a car to accommodate her wish (8 hour round trip train -&gt; 1 hour car detour) and she totally made the right call. Even the drive was lovely:

<p>The town really is as cute as advertised:

<p>Apparently outside of covid it’s extremely popular but for now the tourists are really minimal.

<p>I’m not sure I’ll rush to come back here but I definitely need to go to <em>some</em> kind of beautifully clear mountain lake this summer:

<p>We did a little hike around nearby before heading to Salzburg. I hope this is for firewood an not people.
