<h1> Random Pretty Buildings</h1>
<p> 28 Sep 2021  </p>

<p>Vienna is absolutely lousy with pretty buildings, for instance, this one is absolutely nothing special but in any other city it would probably stand out. It’s just block after block of very ornamented five-or-so-story buildings.

<p>Old facades are often preserved and the building itself modernized when needed.

<p>Even the more modern/austere buildings have ornamentation, like this… bas-relief of a hunting party?

<p>There is cool street art all along the Donaukanal.

<p>Some of the street art is less good.
