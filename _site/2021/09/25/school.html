<h1> School</h1>
<p> 25 Sep 2021  </p>

<p>One of my first days in Vienna I went to check out campus since I was living nearby at the time.</p>

<p>I haven’t gone into the library yet because covid limitations plus a reservation system I can’t figure out means I keep getting turned away. The outside has this funky 70s owl that I’m quite fond of though.

<p>For some architectural whiplash, the main campus is near Karlsplatz:

<p>The CS building isn’t as impactful but I do like the metal letters floating over the building.

<p>My first school event was an orientation that included free beer :’) and turned into more late night beers in the courtyard and then even later beers in the park in front of the church. The amount of casual outside drinking blows my mind every time it happens.</p>

<p>More importantly, this is the first day that I started to realize my worries about making new friends would be overblown. I think it’s a combination of the school mindset–people are in meet-new-people mode–and the reopening after covid mindset.
