<h1> Leaving</h1>
<p> 23 Sep 2021  </p>

<p>Got down to three bags + backpack before leaving the US in September.

<p>“Why Vienna?” is a question I get from a lot of people (espeically the locals) so I feel like I have my set of answers at this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was ready for a change in scenery but wasn’t excited enough about any particular place in the US to try to move there. I also credit Marina Milan as a major inspiration/role model because she actually acted on the feeling that she needed a change of pace even if life at home was good.</li>
  <li>I speak some German (quickly and quietly so people don’t catch my mistakes or anything at all that I’m saying) but the program is in English so I don’t need to speak <em>that</em> much German.</li>
  <li>It’s a great deal! School is much cheaper, even for a master’s degree unlike some of the cash cow masters degrees at home.</li>
  <li>I have some friends from home who live here and can help me when I need it.</li>
  <li>I feel like I didn’t take enough advantage of the summer I spent here in high school so this is round 2!</li>
  <li>The program is suprisingly exactly what I want to do: a master’s degree in CS that focuses on math, formal methods, and logic instead of generic software development or a specialty that doesn’t interest me like machine learning. When I found it I felt a little like the stars were aligning.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a retroactive blog post but all the reasoning above has held up and the transition has been surprisingly smooth!</p>
