Mostly I was in a little village (&amp;lt;500 people!) in former east Germany where my mom taught English after the wall fell.
Most people there don’t use English as frequently as my average Austrian university classmate so I did a lot of language practice. 
It also helps that elementary school teachers, like a lot of the women in the family, have can switch to using small words and enunciating, even when they’ve been retired for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to think of a more different experience from being a graduate student than getting swept into a multigenerational family in a village!
We aren’t related but enough of them held me as a baby that there isn’t really a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/kirche.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
The village itself is clustered around this church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/tur.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/rath.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
The nearest town has some great architecture, and it made me realize that I had been in Austria long enough to get culture shock from going to Germany!
Sort of makes sense though, it’s so German there that you can accidentally drive past the house Otto von Bismark was born in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/fire.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/luft.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
The night after Easter we had a bonfire during which I got drunk completely under the table by a kindly 19 year old. 
Always dangerous when the knockoff schnapps named after the nearest town comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/truck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Instead of the float boats I’m used to the old barns here have ancient fire trucks (now outfitted with a keg tap in the back).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/puppet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
It’s always puppets with these people (Germans).
Thought they were real children and almost jumped out of my skin.
They’re an exhibit in a natural history museum and you can listen to them have a debate about preserving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This museum was great because the German was around my level (small child).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wust/birb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/melk/stick.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went relatively well! I need to try driving a few other cars to get a feel for when the clutch engages in general not just how it feels in the one car but short of merging onto a really busy highway I feel like I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving lessons were about an hour and a half train ride away in Melk, a city famous for its abbey:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/melk/abbey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had dinner with my friend’s family, which included this truly incredible view from the dining/living room/kitchen area.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/melk/view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During driving lesson 2 a week later I practiced some mountain and highway driving (I was not taking pictures but it was beautiful) and stopped in a town called Scheibbs for coffee and helped a group of 8 Ohioan exchange students to explain how they wanted the check split. It’s fun to get out of the cities like Vienna and Salzburg and truly touristy towns like Hallstatt and see the countryside (yay c*rs!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Scheibbs highlight:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/melk/mural.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Guardians of Ga’Hoole, right?

It was fun to get the insider tour of things like the last water driven flour mill that makes delicious brioche with raisins warm from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put our luggage in the train station lockers (so convenient!) and left to walk around the city. Austrians have their own unique locker sizing system:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/size.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked around some of the same palaces, I still appreciate this box:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts of Salzburg that leave the valley offer some great views, although the downside of wandering around with a local is comments like “oh yeah, everyone takes a picture of that.” Oh well, the majority has the right idea.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/everyone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also picked up on a few things I didn’t see last time, like this antique store called “electric lobster.”
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/lobst.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, more pathetically, the fanciest McDonald’s sign I’ve ever seen:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/mcyds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to the town of Hallein to do a salt mine tour.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/hallein.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town has a museum about salt extraction through the ages and a reconstruction Celtic village, unsurprisingly when I make a group of friends it’s the kind of group that would like to spend an hour looking at potsherds and grave goods then poking around in tiny thatched huts. For the mine tour itself we did a lot of walking through tunnels wearing our coats tucked into our mine jumpsuits and took a ferry across an underground salt lake.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/salz2/hot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also took a quick trip to Germany!

I got to go to my favorite market and then spend the day cooking for a relatively large group of groups of friends (15 people maybe?). Not a bad start to my late 20s (thanks for pointing out that milestone Han).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone got along and everyone got negative covid tests before they came over. I don’t have any pictures of before the party and I don’t have the full aftermath either but here’s halfway through cleanup:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bday.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spritzers are a genius drink because you stay really hydrated. Since Europeans from a wine producing country invented it adding seltzer to your wine becomes acceptable somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No smelly pile of oyster shells to deal with like my last big birthday party (god I miss fish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flour is different here, a cake recipe I’ve made plenty of times was a greasy mess. Everyone still told me it was good and now I have trust issues. Thankfully two other cakes were contributed, one of them an official Sachertorte in a wrapped wooden box that I refuse to check the cost on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my birthday was roughly in the middle of exams, which are roughly in the middle of the end of classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew how good I had it with midterms! Going through a whole semester of material is unpleasant and because I didn’t think I had to worry about tests until all my classes were over they sort of snuck up on me. Oh well, you can retake things up to 4 times, which is kind of crazy, but things aren’t scaled at all like at home. Why did I decide I should try to get good grades? If I get solid Ds I’ll have a 4.0 the way grade averages work here, that’s plan B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to retake both exams I’ve taken so far (yuck).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Lee</name></author><summary type="html">Had a great birthday!

To me it’s like the Viennese equivalent of a classic American diner, the food is cheap and comes in large portions (ok, Europe large) and you can choose from a limited array of traditional options. It feels like it’s in the only place it could exist in. The booths are upholstered in a green velvet that’s just a little bit shabby, which I think makes it more relaxing to spend a few hours chatting here.

&lt;p&gt;I did think their collection of books was a little funny.

&lt;p&gt;They also have the standard newspapers-on-wicker-frames that I think are really cool, but I didn’t get a picture so here’s one stolen from Google Maps that kind of features them:

&lt;p&gt;Very cute! A little expensive but I did buy kale and beans (avocados here are for emergency use only). They had some tasty chocolate dipped spelt cookies too. I can’t get over that spelt is called “Dinkel” here so I feel driven to buy anything made with it.
