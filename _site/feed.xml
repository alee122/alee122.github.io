&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/xmasmarkt/chandom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a tree outside Stephansdom, the major gothic church in the city center. The ladder on the steeple is some kind of art installment that has been there since I arrived.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/xmasmarkt/treedom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;treedom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a Christmas market outside there but I would like to get slightly less fleeced so I went to the market in the courtyard of the main university for mulled wine and to poke around the little pop up shops with candles and stuff.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/xmasmarkt/lights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also encountered this horror:

&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/row/boothaus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boothaus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of joining a club was the chance to access a wider circle of friends if I was having trouble making them at school, but that has gone just fine. Instead I think it will be a good venue for practicing German because rowers only have 5 conversations anyway. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/row/boats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far it’s a good place to practice understanding the Viennese accent/dialect (not sure where to draw the line) with the coach who is from an older generation and doesn’t switch to English immediately. His feedback on my form must be about one of the finite number of things I’ve done wrong for years so I can understand what he’s commenting on once I fix the problem and he says something approving.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Lee</name></author><summary type="html">Finally got in touch with the rowing club I wanted to join by resorting to the, shudder, phone.

That means I’ve been checking out different random libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Austria has a legal library with some carrels and an atrium that I think is really neat. If you go up to the roof there’s a cafe that’s only slightly overpriced with a great view of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to go through a metal detector to get in and it’s much easier to gain entrance if you are conservatively dressed instead of going with your punk friend who won’t remove his 80 or so safety pins from his bag and coat and just leaves instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-libraries-include&quot;&gt;Other libraries include:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I learned that the song “Cotton Eye Joe” is apparently popular in Sweden but not the easy line dance associated with it. How on earth you’d ever encounter that song outside of a line dance context beats me completely, but while the song was well known the existence of the dance was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dressed up as the Evergiven, the boat that got stuck in the Suez Canal, by wearing a thrifted skirt with sort of container-ish colored rectangles on it as a shirt and green shorts with “EVERGREEN” written in white tape. Sadly I did not commit to the performative aspect and block people in doorways because I would just reflexively move out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Lee</name></author><summary type="html">Halloween isn’t really a thing here but I did get invited to an American friend’s Halloween party.

&lt;p&gt;Lectures, especially math lectures on a blackboard, are pretty much exactly like at home with one exception. When you want to ask a question you knock sharply on your desk right before you raise you hand, it’s extremely shocking in person and I feel crazy rude every time I do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It almost makes up for how inconvenient it is to find things that are normally present in US supermarkets in major cities:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/markets/fsh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fsh&quot; /&gt;
At some point I will pay 5 euros for a can of tomatillos and be deeply resentful. But I think the situation will improve as I build up my pantry stash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go on a nice hike up a mountain (their label not mine, and technically an Alp!) and then on the way down stop at a vineyard every 100 feet or so. We just caught the end of sturm season, which is a lightly fermented cloudy wine that is really sweet but goes down easily with some brown bread and different sausages and mustards.

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I still feel this way when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; live in a foreign country because I was very happy to help my housemate pick up various secondhand pieces of furniture as an excuse to be nosy and see cool courtyard entrances like this:

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’m not creepy about it and was actually invited to my friends’ houses. I don’t know why I like her kitchen so much but I like that you really couldn’t find something like this in the US. I think the ceilings are 12 feet?
