Had a great birthday! I got to go to my favorite market and then spend the day cooking for a relatively large group of groups of friends (15 people maybe?). Not a bad start to my late 20s (thanks for pointing out that milestone Han).

Everyone got along and everyone got negative covid tests before they came over. I don't have any pictures of before the party and I don't have the full aftermath either but here's halfway through cleanup:

Spritzers are a genius drink because you stay really hydrated. Since Europeans from a wine producing country invented it adding seltzer to your wine becomes acceptable somehow.

No smelly pile of oyster shells to deal with like my last big birthday party (god I miss fish).

Flour is different here, a cake recipe I've made plenty of times was a greasy mess. Everyone still told me it was good and now I have trust issues. Thankfully two other cakes were contributed, one of them an official Sachertorte in a wrapped wooden box that I refuse to check the cost on.

Unfortunately my birthday was roughly in the middle of exams, which are roughly in the middle of the end of classes. 

I never knew how good I had it with midterms! Going through a whole semester of material is unpleasant and because I didn't think I had to worry about tests until all my classes were over they sort of snuck up on me. Oh well, you can retake things up to 4 times, which is kind of crazy, but things aren't scaled at all like at home. Why did I decide I should try to get good grades? If I get solid Ds I'll have a 4.0 the way grade averages work here, that's plan B.

I'm going to retake both exams I've taken so far (yuck).
