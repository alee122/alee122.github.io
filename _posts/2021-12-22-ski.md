My family has had tickets to visit for Christmas for a few months and ultimately they did decide to make the trip! Dad and I got some skiing in the week before Christmas to skip the crowds.

It was actually my first time leaving the city since I've moved here. We went to the ski resort closest to the city, about an hour and a half by train.

There was definitely a bus from the train station to the resort proper but we decided to just go by foot instead of trying to figure it out. We followed an older lady who had all her gear and was not interested in chatting with us but at least was obviously on her way to go skiing.

Really beautiful panorama, but I think my expectations were a little too high. I thought my mind was going to be blown the first time I went skiing somewhere other than the ice coast but really it was just like a slightly better than average day at home. Apparently stunning conditions aren't guaranteed if you don't go all the way to Tyrol.
