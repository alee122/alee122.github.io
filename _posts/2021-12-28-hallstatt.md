We knew we wanted to spend some time seeing more of Austria (partially to give our lovely host a break from us) so that we could visit Salzburg where mom studied abroad in college and where she and my dad went on their first trip together. 

Hannah insisted on trying to go to Hallstatt too, despite the crazy additional train time and transfers it would take, all for a town that you can walk through in 20 minutes or so. Ultimately we decided to take a car to accommodate her wish (8 hour round trip train -> 1 hour car detour) and she totally made the right call. Even the drive was lovely:

The town really is as cute as advertised:

Apparently outside of covid it's extremely popular but for now the tourists are really minimal.

I'm not sure I'll rush to come back here but I definitely need to go to *some* kind of beautifully clear mountain lake this summer:

We did a little hike around nearby before heading to Salzburg. I hope this is for firewood an not people.
