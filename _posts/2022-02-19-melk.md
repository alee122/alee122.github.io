Specifically, living my dream of learning to drive stick.

It went relatively well! I need to try driving a few other cars to get a feel for when the clutch engages in general not just how it feels in the one car but short of merging onto a really busy highway I feel like I get it. 

Driving lessons were about an hour and a half train ride away in Melk, a city famous for its abbey:

I also had dinner with my friend's family, which included this truly incredible view from the dining/living room/kitchen area.

During driving lesson 2 a week later I practiced some mountain and highway driving (I was not taking pictures but it was beautiful) and stopped in a town called Scheibbs for coffee and helped a group of 8 Ohioan exchange students to explain how they wanted the check split. It's fun to get out of the cities like Vienna and Salzburg and truly touristy towns like Hallstatt and see the countryside (yay c\*rs!).

A Scheibbs highlight:

This is Guardians of Ga'Hoole, right? Extremely specific mural for a random alley in 2022.
