I visited west Germany for the first time instead of Wust or Berlin.
Took the train there (was not allowed to pay for my ticket, everyone I was visiting was overwhelmingly nice) and got out at this giant station after some games of cards on the way.

Didn't really have any expectations going in, Hamburg has a canal district with some interesting old buildings, which I didn't successfully capture.

The city hall is very cool.

But mostly I was excited about the fresh fish (on bread rolls).

I went to the immigration museum since this is likely the port that some of my family left from to go to the US.
A lot of the exhibits reminded me of visiting Ellis Island a few years ago, but it was interesting to see it from my different point of view after having my own (albeit cushy) immigration experience.
Definitely makes you appreciate modern communication technology and airplanes, it can be hard to be so far from home but it's almost impossible to be as far as you once would be.

Nothing at the URL, disappointing.
