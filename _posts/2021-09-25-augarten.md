Augarten is one of my favorite parks in Vienna, the garden itself is beautiful and the WWII flak tower that looms over it makes for a striking metaphor for the last two centuries of Austrian history.

Serious thoughts aside, it's also a good place to have a schnitzel and a beer with some new friends and reflect on the fact that you've moved to a country where the national dish is basically a big chicken nugget.
