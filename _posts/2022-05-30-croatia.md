My friend Felicia and I got to take a fun road trip with our friend Anita and her brother to visit Zagreb and their cabin in Dalmatia.
Maybe 5 games of 20 questions (my go-to object was less annoying to them than it is at home), a whole alphabet game (where different letters are impossible to find than at home, no "exit" signs to get you an x) later we made it to the triple decker they grew up in.

It's so fun to visit your friends in the places they call home and see how it influenced them.
Things that aren't important enough that someone would tell you but it all clicks: "Oh, you like oldies because Zagreb's FM Gold only plays public domain songs and that's your driving station."

## Zagreb
Had a fun day wandering through Zagreb, which feels like a real city to me for some reason in a way that Vienna doesn't always.
The Croatia Rick Steves episode has come on after dinner at home often enough that I knew a weird amount about different landmarks.

Zagreb old city still uses gas lamps.

## Rovanjska

After a night in Zagreb we went to Anita's family house in a little village (around 200 locals and then maxes out at about 500 in the summer when you add backpackers, Austrians, and Zagrebians).

Her mother, who is the head of infectious diseases at a hospital in the city and definitely has better things to do, left us bean soup with homemade sausages and then containers of home cured bacon and more sausage.

The Adriatic sea is about two minutes from the front door and shade trees go all the way down to the water so I managed to not get sunburned hanging out in a hammock for hours.

The house is old and charmingly pokey in a way that makes me feel like I'm truly on vacation.

I spent most of my time in either a bathing suit or a loose linen dress I imagine is the uniform for some kind of artist's retreat, except I was doing math instead.

The mugs remind me of the ones at Lake Cobbosee, not what the actually say but that you'd have sturdy dishware that doesn't take itself seriously.

Across the cove there's a tiny lighthouse and, apparently, wild mussels you can gather.

## Zadar
We did a night out in the closest city, where we listened to the organ played by the sea, had good seafood and made eyes at some basketball players playing 3x3 by the old Roman forum.

The city was once controlled by Venice, which built the defensive wall around the old city with the winged lion over the gate.

There's a beautiful park next to the old city dedicated to a former queen with one main path spiraling up past plants brought home by sailors over the centuries.

We didn't make it to Plitvice on our drive out because it was too rainy to walk on the boardwalks, but we did see a town built straddling similar waterfalls.
Next time!
