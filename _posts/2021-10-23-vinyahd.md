Vienna is the only capital city in the world with working vineyards in the city limits. Evidence:

You can go on a nice hike up a mountain (their label not mine, and technically an Alp!) and then on the way down stop at a vineyard every 100 feet or so. We just caught the end of sturm season, which is a lightly fermented cloudy wine that is really sweet but goes down easily with some brown bread and different sausages and mustards.

I also got my annual dose of good foliage.
