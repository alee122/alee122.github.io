Vienna has already decorated for Christmas in the first district with some outdoor chandeliers:

There's also a tree outside Stephansdom, the major gothic church in the city center. The ladder on the steeple is some kind of art installment that has been there since I arrived.

There's a Christmas market outside there but I would like to get slightly less fleeced so I went to the market in the courtyard of the main university for mulled wine and to poke around the little pop up shops with candles and stuff.

I also encountered this horror:
