I'm very grateful to have one lecture in person, even if it is at 8am Thursday and Friday and the last 30 minutes of the two hours basically passes through my brain without leaving a trace. Today it was randomly in a different lecture hall with a cool building to look at after my capacity for absorbing graduate discrete math ran out.

Lectures, especially math lectures on a blackboard, are pretty much exactly like at home with one exception. When you want to ask a question you knock sharply on your desk right before you raise you hand, it's extremely shocking in person and I feel crazy rude every time I do it myself.

A nice post-class sunrise.
