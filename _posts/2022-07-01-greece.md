Christina has family in Rhodes I've heard about her visiting for years so now that I'm 2 hours away I brattily got myself invited to join.
First, the water is insane:

That picture is from the top of an acropolis and then later we went down to swim in that bay and it was just as amazing as it looks.

We stayed in the old town of the main city, full of small alleys and absolutely crawling with stray cats.

This guy was my favorite, he always had his forehead against something (the ground, a door frame) while he napped.

This was my first time in a country that doesn't use the Roman alphabet, but I could still recognize enough since I use them for math that I could verify that the gyro stand did say it sold gyros.

All the streets of the old city are cobbled with smooth sea stones, sometimes in elaborate patterns.

Where the colossus might have stood (had to check that out of course) there are now two statues of the local breed of deer.

Besides the ancient history there was also a medieval outpost for crusaders that was then taken over by the Turks, who also shaped the city.
Besides several mosques they also left this library:

The food was incredibly good but the best thing I ate was freshly fried cod with something like garlic mashed potatoes.
"Garlic mashed potatoes" makes you think of something hot and rich but this was just potatoes and garlic, lean and cold.
Somehow perfect with steaming hot, flaky cod and a squeeze of lemon.

The same restaurant had live music some nights and extremely nice owners.

My favorite beach is the one near the little 1950s aquarium, the ground drops off really fast but the water is so clear you think you're feet from the bottom.
The aquarium has tiles for each island in the chain that includes Rhodes.

Only downside was getting pretty sunburned, not sure the mythical home of the sun god is the right place for me.
Christina's great aunt thought the same thing, she switched to English to tell me "You should go back to Vienna" after seeing how red I was.
I cracked up, she's not wrong and apparently Vienna is her favorite city so I felt like I was being nudged toward a place I could survive better, not exiled.
