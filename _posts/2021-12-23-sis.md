I got to buy Hannah her first drink in a bar even though it isn't her 21st birthday.

After the fancy bar we went and got schnitzel, fries, and tallboys from a street cart while it was raining and Hannah drank the rest of her beer after we both dropped them on the ground :') I'm no longer on that level, that's how I know I'm getting old, I donated mine to the storm drain. I think we did a good job running the gamut of drinking experiences.

We also checked out some places I've been meaning to go. 12 euros for curried lentils should be a crime but the place is so pretty!
