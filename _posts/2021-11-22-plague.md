Austria has a nationwide lockdown as of today so this weekend I made sure to take advantage of the kinds of things that will be closed: restaurants, bars, coffee shops, movie theaters, museums. In kind of a morbid frame of mind I visited the plague monument:

And finally went to the Secession museum to see the Beethoven frieze, which also features Pestilence.

Even the church near my school was built in honor of the end of a pandemic, the pediment has a tiny Vienna skyline in the background which you can't really see in this bad picture but trust me.

The older art refer to pandemics past, but contemporary art hasn't gotten to the triumphal stage yet.

We were lucky to have a really beautiful weekend.

Besides going to museums I made sure to go out for food that I won't make at home, especially if it's also an Austrian specialty. So: giant Wiener schnitzel the size of my face, Kaiserschmarrn (sort of a pancake dish; easy to make at home but I wanted to know what it should taste like), and finally:

(I sent this picture to my friend who is also a recent transplant from Boston and she sent back a picture of a half dozen donuts she and her boyfriend bought.)
