Went to Berlin to see a Bonobo show with my mom's college roommate's former high school exchange student.
I had met her a few times but unfortunately she moved away from Vienna before Christmas so it was nice to see her again!
Show was fantastic too.

I had free lodging too, with my mom's high school classmate who has been living in Germany for decades.
This vacation brought to me by my mom!

Didn't get to see a ton of Berlin besides the concert but did spend a nice afternoon (a *Sunday* afternoon!) in a library getting some leftover homework done.

Ate d√∂ner kebab twice in 3 days, it is way better in Berlin.
