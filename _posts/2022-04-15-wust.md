Went to Germany for Easter break!
Mostly I was in a little village (<500 people!) in former east Germany where my mom taught English after the wall fell.
Most people there don't use English as frequently as my average Austrian university classmate so I did a lot of language practice. 
It also helps that elementary school teachers, like a lot of the women in the family, have can switch to using small words and enunciating, even when they've been retired for years.

Hard to think of a more different experience from being a graduate student than getting swept into a multigenerational family in a village!
We aren't related but enough of them held me as a baby that there isn't really a difference.

The village itself is clustered around this church.

The nearest town has some great architecture, and it made me realize that I had been in Austria long enough to get culture shock from going to Germany!
Sort of makes sense though, it's so German there that you can accidentally drive past the house Otto von Bismark was born in.

Always weird to see houses this old still being casually lived in.

The night after Easter we had a bonfire during which I got drunk completely under the table by a kindly 19 year old. 
Always dangerous when the knockoff schnapps named after the nearest town comes out.

Instead of the float boats I'm used to the old barns here have ancient fire trucks (now outfitted with a keg tap in the back).

It's always puppets with these people (Germans).
Thought they were real children and almost jumped out of my skin.
They're an exhibit in a natural history museum and you can listen to them have a debate about preserving the environment.

This museum was great because the German was around my level (small child).

You think you have some understanding of a place until you run into the pet ostrich.
