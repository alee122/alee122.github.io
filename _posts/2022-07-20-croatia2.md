Got to go collect/harvest wild mussels!
I totally shattered my phone in my rush to document this.

That's what I get for being so happy my phone didn't really work last time but still needing a hotspot for working on my presentation, I got what I wanted.

We crammed I think 8 people into Anita's house? 
The water was so refreshing because springs keep it from getting too warm, the fresh water flowing from them sits on top of the salt water.
This time we went to one of the larger springs and the water was delicious.
