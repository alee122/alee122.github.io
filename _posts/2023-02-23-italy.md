Since Hannah isn't studying abroad in Italy (it's ok Hannah, I think 70% of people in Florence are American exchange students at least based on walking around) I decided I wanted to go for a trip during my break because if I don't take the chance to take a night train to Venice on a whim what am I even doing here.

I love travelling in the off season, even Venice wasn't too packed except for one or two main streets.

## Night train tips:
* Lay flat beds are only an extra 20 euros, if only that's how air travel worked! Another 20 gets you 2 carriage mates not 5 and a shower that I assume feels like a coffin but still.
* They do have provide a sheet, blanket, and pillow.
* Request the top bunk because there's less light in your eyes (advice came after ticket booking).
* Maybe get enough people together so you can book a compartment with only people you know and not 3 strangers and a precarious racing bike.
* Bring earplugs (not crucial).
* Bring eye mask (forgot to find, definitely crucial for bottom bunk).
* Bring a native speaker to talk to the eight year old struggling to open the lock to get to the bathroom at 2am.

# Venice Morning

I ended up with a weird number of pictures of Venetian laundry, I think I just like the sign that people really live there and I'm also impressed by the daring.
This is across from the one ![coffee roaster](https://goo.gl/maps/TT5KM6coDFgUnjmn8) in Venice, from 1930 something, and it has really amazing pistachio-filled cornetti.

We got to Venice the day before Carnival and there were masked people people everywhere but also people who fully committed.
They would unhurriedly walk as if they were the most dignified people in existence and never speak to anyone but pose for pictures in a sort of menacing way.

There was a huge group of them near the arsenal, which is still owned by the Italian navy but makes a great backdrop.
Apparently it was an early example of an assembly line in the early 1600s could turn out a warship in one day, which inspired George RR Martin to say the same thing about the arsenal of Braavos.

A pomeranian dressed as a gondolier did a fair amount of scene stealing.

DHL boat fleet by Rialto market! 
Paid 5 euros for an underwhelming oyster.
Also nearby: 2 euros for someone to row you directly across the canal in a packed gondola; Rick Steves says the locals stand when they take it so I did, probably stressed out the gondoliers.
That along with 9 euros for the water bus all the way down the grand canal I felt I got a solid amount of boat time for the money.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/strokes.jpg)
Apparently I have a more boisterous clone who lives in Venice and is also still listening to The Strokes after 2 decades, at least that's what I choose to believe.
I just found out Julian Casablancas recorded ![a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yvEYKRF5IA) with The Lonely Island 14 years ago and I can't stop listening, he went way harder than he needed to.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/cynar.jpg)
The train we meant to take to Florence was full but that meant an hour and a half to drink Cynar spritzes by a canal because I liked the beat up tables, no stress.

# Florence
## Day 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/bakery.jpg)
Five minutes from the AirBnB (cheap off season) there was ![a little cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/gnKPUjmMQTanxkNn7) recommended by ![Emiko Davies](https://www.emikodavies.com/), the Florentine blogger I like.
Under 3 euros for a pastry and a cappuccino, fantastic, we went every morning (all two of them but still).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/market.jpg)
The farmer's market near the cafe made me as sad as I expected, really amazing vegetables including Good Kale and this weird celery thing I had never seen before.
This one is actually pretty picturesque, there were some truly monstrous ones at different stalls that had been covered in dirt for the winter to swell underground and get more tender.

Pretty good! Artichoke-y, as I discovered when I finally got around to eating it this morning.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/oranges.jpg)
Also nearby, a pretty square with orange trees where I gave eating a traditional tripe sandwich my best effort.
Not bad but could have used more salsa verde and about  half the tripe, or the same amount of tripe minced up a bit more for me to really enjoy it.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/books.jpg)
On one side of the square there was a little mobile bookseller.

Even though I had tripe for lunch (having it for breakfast didn't seem like it would be giving it a fair shot) I decided to get a second lunch at ![a restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/5BY6Ej68ni3rfGtX8) tucked behind touristy leather stalls.
This place has been in my heart as one my top five sandwiches ever and going back didn't disappoint. 
Not only that but they had the ingredients listed for the salsa verde for that sandwich (the other components are porchetta and pickled red onions).

It's acidic without being watery because it has bread crumbs soaked in vinegar instead of just vinegar!

Closed out the day on a very nice overlook where I took some generic pictures but mostly just watched the lights come on in a mild drizzle.

## Day 2

The second day in Florence we went to the other side of the river to check out a market I remembered liking where someday I hope to get ![chestnut pancakes](https://www.emikodavies.com/preserving-the-taste-of-autumn/) but this time just got told that I looked beautiful in a hat by an older lady, I'll take it (but not the hat).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/wine_window.jpg)
For pre-lunch we went to one of the wine windows into restaurants that were installed during the plague and reopened during covid.
Weird how the recent disaster is already fading into something that can have a charming side like the one we have centuries of distance from.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/foccacia.jpg)
I've really wanted to try focaccia di recco, which requires a really specific cheese, since I saw it not only from ![Emiko Davies](https://food52.com/recipes/34089-focaccia-di-recco) but also ![Lady and Pups](https://ladyandpups.com/2017/07/14/chi-spaccas-focaccia-di-recco-or-the-closest-youll-get-to-it-at-home/) who felt it was worth trying to imitate the cheese with what was available to her in Hong Kong.
It's not actually a Florence thing but lo and behold on a list of vegetarian restaurants there was ![a Ligurian one](https://goo.gl/maps/Gnarzrnr1LMFkNuq7) with that on the menu.
Sometimes constraints make you find more interesting things than you would just looking for anywhere to eat, it was delightful, the owner chatted us up since we were the first people there and told me that the dish was his favorite on the whole menu before I even ordered.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/menu.jpg)
Even the bill was nice, in a letterpress little folder which I got to keep after I admired it (and not too expensive either, especially when basically all the other food you eat is street food).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/rower.jpg)
Paused on the way to the train to day dream about rowing through Florence.

# Venice Evening
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/rialto.jpg)
We were at that restaurant when it opened so we could get back to Venice in time for the number one recommendation from the guy in my research group who's from Venice (I am the only non-Italian there): free roof deck reservations at a fancy mall with a great view.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/cicchetti.jpg)
We went to a lot of cicchetti bars but my favorite was one that is apparently normally packed.
There is a gondola boatyard right across the canal, they very nicely made something vegan when none of what they had on display was, and they had an amazing deep fried mozzarella with anchovy that no one else was serving (top left).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/italy/floatie_guy.jpg)
Spent a good 10 minutes unabashedly watching a guy walk along the street with an extremely unstable looking floatie and a paddle, climb into a waiting boat (ok, he's just using it as a weird dinghy...), put on his backpack and put the floatie in the water (!), climb into it (ok, maybe his boat is a little further up the canal?), and row up the empty canal with other alleyways leading to it before there were any other boats.
According to the guy in my research group this is totally wild behavior just like I thought it was.

Really though most of my outrage came from raw jealousy, which luckily I can address when I go with my rowing club for a big Venice row to all the islands.
It's not just a weirdly specific thing for the one club and it's not a race either, it's a takeover of the canals by human propelled boats to protest erosion from cruise ships.
Basically it's the Venice version of the Friday night bike lane protests that take over highways in Vienna.

I really have not posted in a while! So if you are using an RSS feed (hi Arthur) these are going to be backwards for a while.
I will write the backlog though, Lent Alice is extremely functional and tends to side projects because there's no phone solitaire while listening to a podcast allowed.
