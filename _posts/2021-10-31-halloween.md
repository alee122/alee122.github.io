Halloween isn't really a thing here but I did get invited to an American friend's Halloween party. We played stack cup with cups a guest had gone far out of his way to acquire apparently...

And I learned that the song "Cotton Eye Joe" is apparently popular in Sweden but not the easy line dance associated with it. How on earth you'd ever encounter that song outside of a line dance context beats me completely, but while the song was well known the existence of the dance was not.

I dressed up as the Evergiven, the boat that got stuck in the Suez Canal, by wearing a thrifted skirt with sort of container-ish colored rectangles on it as a shirt and green shorts with "EVERGREEN" written in white tape. Sadly I did not commit to the performative aspect and block people in doorways because I would just reflexively move out of the way.
