This is essentially another entry in the series of posts about how nice it is to live somewhere rent is cheap. Someone liked a classic movie set here enough to dedicate three store fronts to displaying his personal collection of Japanese record releases of the soundtrack etc.

The museum is open one day a week and otherwise you have to request that they open it for you on a specific day. It's not like this is in the middle of nowhere either, it's right by my school. It's a good movie if you get the chance to watch it but dang.

It also has some interesting historical information about the time period the movie was shot in: the ground was still covered in the rubble from WWII bombings and the city was split into four quarters like Berlin.

My family also made time to go on the ferris wheel from the climax of the film. This picture roughly points at my new apartment.

The soundtrack holds up, actually, if you like increasingly frantic zither playing (and I do, apparently).
