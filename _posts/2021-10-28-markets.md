I was excited to leave behind the American tradition of the weekly shop and planning meals weeks at a time instead of a quick shop every few days for whatever you feel like eating or when you can stop by a convenient street market and for the most part that has panned out!

It almost makes up for how inconvenient it is to find things that are normally present in US supermarkets in major cities:

At some point I will pay 5 euros for a can of tomatillos and be deeply resentful. But I think the situation will improve as I build up my pantry stash.

I got here in time for the last apricots:

My impulse shopping for vegetables usually ends up staying under 10 euros

Just some veggie glamor shots:
