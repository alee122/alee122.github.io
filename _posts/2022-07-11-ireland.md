Christina and I did a final stop in Dublin, for her to sort of relive her study abroad experience without the horrible deja vu of Galway and for me to enjoy a (primarily, I guess I have to add) English speaking country.
I got a little misty-eyed when I saw "bus" written on the pavement from the window of the plane.
No idea why that did it, it's the same word in German.

Seeing Trinity college gave me a bit more empathy for people who go on tours of Harvard for no reason.

I don't think Widener is on this level though.

Went on an hour long bus journey to the sea which did actually pay off with a lovely cliff walk that felt like actually seeing the countryside.

## Suggestions:
* *Joy of Cha* for an affordable full Irish breakfast, which I did not photograph because it's better to just eat it.
* *Book of Kells* because Hannah and I loved the movie about it growing up and it's beautiful, and which I did not photograph because it's not allowed.
* *The Cobblestone* a pub with great live music every night.
* *Howth* for the great cliff walk.
* *The Cake Cafe* for high tea, enter through the used bookstore called The Last Bookshop.
