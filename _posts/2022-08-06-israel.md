I started out in Haifa for the Federated Logic Conference, where I didn't embarrass myself presenting a paper and met a lot of cool people in my little career niche.

I spent most of my time at the conference but did quickly stop by a convenience store and thought it was cool to see a whole shelf of different tahini, something you probably couldn't find one jar of in a corner store in the US! 
I like seeing the staple grocery products in different places.

Haifa is a little quiet but does have a beautiful Baha'i shrine where the remains of the prophet are interred.

Next stop was Tel Aviv, where I spent a day in the Yemenite district.

There was a cute used book store/cafe called The Little Prince:

The district predates the city of Tel Aviv and is only walkable, with packed markets.

The main reason I wanted to go there was to eat zhug, the herbal/spiced hot sauce which is good in lentil soup:

And in a sandwich for the books: a flaky bread sort of like a good scallion pancake without the scallions filled with zhug, a sliced hardboiled egg, tahini, and crushed fresh tomatoes.

I also swam in the Mediterranean, which had nice waves but was too warm for my taste.

I could have done more in Tel Aviv but I wasn't feeling up to it, unfortunately we had to put Rosie down while I was there.
I'm really enjoying seeing more of the world but there are trade offs, like missing the last year in which you can cuddle your little dog.
