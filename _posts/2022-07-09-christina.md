After I went to Greece Christina and I spent a few days in Austria.

Based on her great aunt's suggestion we went to Sch√∂nbrunn palace.
*Another* palace? I'd been thinking, but it really has amazing gardens and fountains and greenhouses.

This is the first time someone came for long enough to see more than Vienna so we went on a side trip to Melk with bikes in tow.

We biked (with some mechanical issues of my own making and with a rainstorm on our tails) through the Wachau valley, Austria's major wine producing region that runs along the Danube.

We stopped to try a few wines too.

Unfortunately the apricots weren't quite ripe.
