We made it to Salzburg after dark because of our Hallstatt stop but we did go to mom's favorite beer hall from when she was a student (still there, maybe a few more animal skulls on the walls). No luck on the bar that's in a cave where you could push 10 cent pieces into the soft rock until the whole area with in arms reach was silver (or at least this is the story I think I've been told). Still cool to just walk around, the city is built into the cliffs in a lot of places:

Next morning we walked around the old city where we were staying (made parking a nightmare but convenient the next morning). Found a cool display of terrifying hedgehog postcards.

It's really cool to be in the middle of a random street and then there's a giant snowcapped mountain at the end of it. Unfortunately it's a little hard to capture.

We also hiked up to the castle (they let you get to the top before telling you you have to pay).

I think the view was worth it.

The only (grudging) recommendation I got from my Salzburger friend was [a coffee shop](https://www.220grad.com/locations/220grad-nonntal/) and unfortunately we didn't have time to stay. The coffee really was good though and the barista gave me tiny cookies for all four of us.

Some of the fanciest vandalism I've ever seen.

Local beer loyalty.
