Felicia nicely lent me an old phone so I can take some pictures but I missed the main event: the kilogram of apricots my friend got me.

Maybe eight of us went to stay in the countryside for the weekend to see the monastery, eat a lot of Austrian food, and go to a play about the emperor Nero that pushed the limits of my Geman but had great costumes and set design that I could enjoy regardless.

The next morning we went to the palace Franz Ferdinand is buried in and a nearby festival with live music and dancing, I'm deciding whether I should submit my attempt to waltz with my visa renewal.
