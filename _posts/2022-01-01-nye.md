We went to hear Beethoven's 9th at the Grosser Saal, apparently a new year's tradition for a lot of people here. Bad snapchat picture, I realize.

Hannah and I then went to a friend's new years party (our only night to be fancy) and hung out with beers and went to a nearby bridge to watch the illegal fireworks people set off at midnight (and before midnight). The pictures of this are even worse so not included. I obnoxiously started video chats with friends.

At midnight everyone started waltzing, because this is Vienna. Hannah and I stepped on a lot of toes but people were patient and we had plenty of strangers to dance with.

## Resolution: 
Be more aware of how my habits increase or decrease my ability to focus: more regular exercise and books, less sugary food and tiktoks. Not to say I can never be irresponsible but just that when I am it should be fun enough to be worthwhile, not just a mediocre distraction.

One of the best things I could learn from grad school would be how to be more self-driven. I really do enjoy my work when I'm in the zone, it just isn't as instantly rewarding as getting angry about something on twitter or whatever my current distraction of choice is.

I think *A World without Email*'s suggestion of thinking about yourself as having an "organizational mode" that sets you up for your "deep thinking mode" self to be successful might be a worthwhile approach. Next I want to read *Daily Rituals: How Artists Work* because maybe that will help me glamorize having a consistent bedtime and making myself at least go on a walk every day.
