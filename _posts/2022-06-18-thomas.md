Just a brief visit while Thomas enjoyed being unemployed.

Went to a concert at the Volkstheater for the first time, not the normal experience to be in a small side room with a chandelier and marble floor but also a bar and only red lighting.
Apparently I like math rock, the concert was an album release for a band called Zapp Galura, which thankfully decided to go in the direction of the song I did like on their only other release from 2015.

Had a quieter next day taking a slow hike from one winery to the next and just soaking up some evening sun in lounge chairs.

We also did a spontaneous 30km bike ride as part of a weekly protest for more bike lanes that I've done a couple times.
The police shut down roads and highways so the you (and all the crazy rollerbladers doing tricks) can bike.
