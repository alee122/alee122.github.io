Got down to three bags + backpack before leaving the US in September.

"Why Vienna?" is a question I get from a lot of people (espeically the locals) so I feel like I have my set of answers at this point:
* I was ready for a change in scenery but wasn't excited enough about any particular place in the US to try to move there. I also credit Marina Milan as a major inspiration/role model because she actually acted on the feeling that she needed a change of pace even if life at home was good.
* I speak some German (quickly and quietly so people don't catch my mistakes or anything at all that I'm saying) but the program is in English so I don't need to speak *that* much German.
* It's a great deal! School is much cheaper, even for a master's degree unlike some of the cash cow masters degrees at home.
* I have some friends from home who live here and can help me when I need it.
* I feel like I didn't take enough advantage of the summer I spent here in high school so this is round 2!
* The program is suprisingly exactly what I want to do: a master's degree in CS that focuses on math, formal methods, and logic instead of generic software development or a specialty that doesn't interest me like machine learning. When I found it I felt a little like the stars were aligning.

This is a retroactive blog post but all the reasoning above has held up and the transition has been surprisingly smooth!
