	<h1>Mainstream Marketing Services v. Federal Trade Commission.</h1>
	</a>
	<h2>358 F. 3d 1228 - Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit 2004</h2>
	<h3>Issue</h3>
		<p>Does the national "do-not-call list" violate the First Amendment rights of commercial telemarketers?</p>
	<h3>Procedural History</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> <h4>Parties</h4></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Plaintiffs:</em> Mainstream Marketing Services, Inc.; 
										 TMG Marketing, Inc.; 
										 American Teleservices Association</li>
				<li><em>Defendant:</em> Federal Trade Commission</li>
			</ul>
		<li><h4>Procedural Posture</h4></li>
		<ul>
		<li>The plaintiffs each filed separately but their cases were combined for this opinion.</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
	<h3>Facts</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Individuals must opt into inclusion on the list.</li>
		<li>Fees are restricted to the amount of money required to maintain the list.</li>
		<li>The home has a unique status when it comes to privacy protection.</li>
		<li>More than 50 million telephone numbers have been registered on the do-not-call list, preventing an 
			estimated 137 unwanted calls annually per registrant.</li>
		<li>A per-company do-not-call list has been difficult to enforce and places undue burden on the
			individual.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Holding</h3>
	<p>Do-not-call list upheld in its entirety.</p>
	<h3>Reasoning</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Legal Standing/Rule: Governments can limit less protected forms of speech (such as commercial speech)
			if the limitations are "narrowly tailored" and successful in achieving government interests.</li>
		<li>Facts: The number of individuals that joined the list suggests that the government's interests are 
 			being served (unlike the limited impact of the Discovery Network law) and a more narrowly tailored
			law such as a per company list would not achieve those ends.</li>
		<li>Policy Argument: A do-not-call list does not violate the First Amendment rights of commercial entities
			because the government has justifiable interests in protecting the privacy of individuals in their homes
			and preventing "abusive solicitation;" those interests are upheld by a solution that is a reasonable
			fit.</li>
	</ol>
