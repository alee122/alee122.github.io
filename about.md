I moved from Boston to Vienna to study Logic and Computation at TU Wien but also to deal with my covid cabin fever.

I'll probably use this blog mostly like Instagram ie a post is some pictures and a paragraph or two. But crucially, an Instagram no one will ever see and that has no comments. I can't imagine someone I don't know in real life will ever read this so if you want to comment you can text me.

The pictures will be bad *Mike* because my phone doesn't have a very good camera and I don't care that much but hopefully they get the idea across.
