I am studying Logic and Computation at the Technical University of Vienna. I moved here from Boston in September and I decided to start a blog because I don't really use social media because people might see what I post there. This is a nice place to post things without anyone getting a notification that I think what I'm doing is important to post about.

I'll probably use this mostly like Instagram? Just a picture and a few paragraphs when I post? But no one will see and even if someone does I won't really know.

The pictures will be bad *Mike Yeung* because my phone doesn't have a very good camera and I don't care that much but hopefully they get the idea across.

Vienna is cool!
